**Project:** Hyde

**Group Member Names:** Matt Pindell, Sal Espinosa

**What does each group member hope to get out of the project? What are your goals and expectations for the project?**
Both members agree that completing the project is the primary goal, working to improve code is a close second, and pushing for extensions will be third. Both members also agree that these are achievable goals if we work hard through the week.
Sal would like to continue to improve his ability to break problems apart, and Matt would like to

**When are group members available to work together? What hours can each group member work individually? Are there any personal time commitments that need to be discussed?**
Team members are each available after Turing's normal hours. Both anticipate that afternoon/evening work will be more productive than morning work. The preference will be to work together in the same room, pairing at a 'battle-station' with two keyboards. Both team members agreed that the first night of work would be one of the most important, and getting an early start will help to prevent any last minute surprises.

**How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?**
Since group members will be working in the same space communication will be in person. To the degree that changes/additions are contemplated when not together, team members will use slack to communicate, and waffle.io to track issues.

**What is each group memberâ€™s self-identified strength(s) technically? What does each group member want to improve on technically? How can the team assist with these improvements?**

*Strengths*

**Sal** Believes that he has shown an ability to get things done. In past projects he has generally been able to complete the project requirements and some or all of the extensions.

**Matt** Feels that, over the course of the Echo projects, he has  increased his understanding of the Ruby fundamentals - as well as his ability to communicate his thoughts while pairing.

*Improvements*

**Sal** Would like to work on cleaning code/refactoring and ensuring that the code reflects the problem (i.e. working to make sure code clearly shows that problems have been broken into their logical components.)

**Matt** Would like to focus on general Ruby Style, specifically implementing suggestions from POODR, as well as breaking methods down into their logical components.

**Which feature(s) does each group member want to work on? Which feature(s) does each group member not want to work on?**
Given that this project is the first opportunity for 1602 to work together in pairs, the team members agree that both team members should have a hand in all parts of the project to the degree possible. Neither team member was able to identify a specific item that they didn't want to work on.

**What is the agreed upon Git workflow? What project management tool will be used? What is the agreed upon procedure for conducting code reviews before merging into master: who will review pull requests, and when?**
Matt will fork the assignment repo, and add Sal as a collaborator. The two work together on branches named after the iterations and merge to master once iterations have been completed. Any refactoring or other potential changes not specifically described in the assignment will also be done on other branches and merged to either iteration branches or master as appropriate. Since coding will be completed side by side it will be o.k. to merge to master locally and then push to master. Any work completed separately will be reviewed by the other team member before being pushed to master.

**What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature?**
Team members will be expected to work together to implement all features. Any difficulties in actually implementing a required feature will be handled by working together, talking through potential solutions, and testing potential solutions.

**How does each group member want feedback (both positive and constructive) to be delivered?**
Each team member is comfortable talking through feedback, understands that projects can be stressful, and does not anticipate that they will have an issue receiving direct, constructive criticism.

**Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles?**
Not at this time.
